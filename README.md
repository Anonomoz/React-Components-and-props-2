We're using the <Product /> in the index.jsx such that it renders two different products: a pineapple and a banana.

We're using three various props. Make this possible by implementing the necessary changes in Product.jsx.

Note: Don't forget to properly handle the price. A price={200} should show $2.00. Give it a try.

When you're done, make sure to view the browser preview tab. We now have a customizable Product component!
